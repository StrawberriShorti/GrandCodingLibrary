When making this website I intended for it to be quite simple to use online and offline.

All you need to do is open the index, and from there you can access all other pages created so far.

The project is a website designed to be more of a library for advanced programmers who need reminders of specific ways to use coding languages.

There is no installation, your PC if windows will automatically come with software to run HTML and CSS code. Simple double click index.html after downloading the folder
named "GrandCodingLibrary2.0"
